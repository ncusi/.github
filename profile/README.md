# 🧠 NCUSI — Nicolaus Copernicus University Software Intelligence Group

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of NCUSI — a research group at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. We explore the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Mining**.

Our work focuses on:
- Mining and understanding software repositories
- Software vulnerability analysis and security
- Automated program repair and LLM-based coding support
- High-performance computing and data-intensive systems

## 🔬 Recent Highlights

We publish in top-tier venues like:
- **IEEE/ACM MSR**
- **IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering**
- **Journal of Intelligent Information Systems**

A few of our recent contributions:
- *Tracking Buggy Files: New Efficient Adaptive Bug File Prediction*
- *The Secret Life of CVEs: An Empirical Study of Vulnerability Evolution*
- *Fast JSON Parsing with GPU Metaprogramming*

## 🛠 Featured Tool

### 🔍 [PatchScope](https://github.com/ncusi/PatchScope)
A tool for automated patch analysis and fine-grained classification of bug fixes. Used in our MSR 2025 studies to analyze the XZ Utils supply chain attack and other security-related commits.
