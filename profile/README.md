# üß† NCUSI ‚Äî Nicolaus Copernicus University Software Intelligence Group

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of NCUSI ‚Äî a research group at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ. We explore the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Mining**.

Our work focuses on:
- Mining and understanding software repositories
- Software vulnerability analysis and security
- Automated program repair and LLM-based coding support
- High-performance computing and data-intensive systems

## üî¨ Recent Highlights

We publish in top-tier venues like:
- **IEEE/ACM MSR**
- **IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering**
- **Journal of Intelligent Information Systems**
